In effect, they quantify the precision of an estimate by incorporating sampling variability, with a wider interval indicating less certainty and a narrower one indicating more precision . A well-constructed confidence interval (typically 95%) has a concrete long-run probability interpretation: if an experiment were repeated numerous times, approximately 95% of those computed intervals would contain the true population value.By often excluding or including key values (like zero for differences), confidence intervals also implicitly inform about statistical significance, reflecting conclusions that mirror those produced by p-value–based hypothesis tests. Moreover, confidence intervals enhance interpretation by explicitly showing the magnitude and uncertainty of an effect, offering richer insight than a mere yes/no verdict of significance—making them especially valuable for assessing both practical and statistical relevance\n",
